This is a S-Lang [1] module for GTK3 [2]
SLgtk3 is based on GTK2 bindings for S-Lang by Mike Noble [3].
I'm very gratefull to him for helping me understand more S-Lang and
SLIRP by reading his code.
Large parts of the module are generated using SLIRP [4] and some
functions are wrapped by hands.

INSTALL
Configuration, build and install steps are not automated  yet.
You have to run '.gencode' to make SLIRP generate the glue code.
Then launch the 'make' command to build the module (you may have to
modify the makefile according to your system) or run 'meson setup
builddir' and 'meson compile -C builddir' if you want to use the meson
build system.
You will have to manually copy the resulting 'gtk3-module.so' (or
builddir 'gtk3-module.so') where other slang modules are installed
(/usr/lib64/slang/v2/modules), and 'gtk3.sl' to local packages
directory (/usr/share/slsh/local-packages).

The 'slgtk3-demo.sl' script in examples directory try to mimic
gtk3-demo from GTK3.

DOC
You should be able to use this module reading detailled GTK3
documentation and s-lang scripts provided in examples directory.
