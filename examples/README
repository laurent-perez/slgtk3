All examples in this directory were adapted from sample C code in
gtk+-3.x.x/demos/gtk-demo
Most of the work was done by the ../admin/c2slang.sh script from SLgtk
by Mike Noble.
You can run these demos by launching 'slgtk3-demo.sl' in this directory.
Original demos from GTK3 distribution can be seen by running
'gtk3-demo' program.
